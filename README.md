Overview

The Smart Industrial Vehicle is an Arduino-based system designed for industrial environments. It integrates sensors and actuators to autonomously monitor environmental conditions and respond accordingly. The project aims to enhance safety, improve automation, and serve as a prototype for smart factory applications.

Key Features
	•	Temperature and humidity monitoring using DHT22 sensor
	•	Gas and smoke detection using MQ2 sensor
	•	Obstacle detection through ultrasonic distance sensor
	•	Real-time alerts using buzzer upon detecting hazardous conditions
	•	Remote control using HC-12 modules and a joystick
	•	Vehicle movement control using DC motors
	•	Live data display on LCD screen
