Industrial Vehicle Project

Overview
The Industrial Vehicle is an Arduino-based system designed to operate in industrial environments. It combines sensors and actuators to autonomously monitor environmental conditions and react accordingly. The vehicle aims to enhance safety, improve automation, and serve as a prototype for smart factory logistics.

Key Features
Temperature and Humidity Monitoring using a DHT22 sensor.
Gas and Smoke Detection via an MQ2 sensor.
Obstacle Avoidance through an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor.
Real-Time Alerts with buzzer notifications in case of danger.
Remote Control using HC-12 wireless modules and a joystick on a secondary Arduino.
DC Motor Control for vehicle movement based on received signals.
Live Data Display on digital LCD screens.

Objectives
Automate environmental monitoring within factories.
Prevent industrial accidents caused by gas leaks or overheating.
Promote IoT integration in industrial systems.
